# About #
GOOSY (GOogle Outlook SYnc application) is an open source Java application that synchronizes contacts (right now only contacts) between Microsoft Outlook and your Google Account.

The main idea is to provide an easy way of syncing Contacts, Calendar and Tasks to the Google account to make them available on your Android phone.

It was made as an alternative to Google's own Google Apps Sync for MicrosoftÂ® Outlook which is only available for businesses and to other commercial or non-free applications.
Right now there are other open-source solutions to sync (like google-contacts-sync or GO Contact Sync / Mod) written in C#, this application is an attempt to provide same or better functionality written in Java.

Recommend this application to others with Google Plus
